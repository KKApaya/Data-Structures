What is Algorithm?

If we want our computer system to do something then we need to give it an algorithm. An algorithm is basically a step by step procedure which is used to solve a problem. At first it may sound you a very difficult term but actually, it is something very important and easy. In order to get a job done by the computer system, you have to explain it about the procedure on how to do it.” This part is essentially known as Algorithm.”

n simple words, it simply means Data which has some structure. A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. Data structures can implement one or more particular abstract data types(ADT), which are the means of specifying the contract of operations and their complexity. In programming, it is used to store a particular type of data in its respective Structure.

Any data structure is designed to organize data to suit a specific purpose so that it can be accessed and worked with in appropriate ways. just like you can put stuff in stacks, queues, heaps, trees, graphs, and buckets – you can do the same thing with data. In computer programming, a data structure may be selected or designed to store data for the purpose of working on it with various algorithms. Different kinds of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized for specific tasks as well.

Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms. Some formal design methods and programming languages emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software design. Data structures can be used to organize the storage and retrieval of information stored in both main memory [RAM] and secondary memory[Hard Disks].
